STEREO PLAYER VERSION 10.0 & 11.0!  THIS IS THE VERSION YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR (UH, WELL, MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T), IT FULLY SUPPORTS ALL OF THE ENHANCED COMMANDS USED BY THE NEW SID-EDITOR (TALKED ABOUT LATER).  IT HAS BEEN OVER ONE AND HALF YEARS SINCE I CAME OUT WITH THE FIRST PLAYER FOR SID MUSIC AND ABOUT ONE YEAR SINCE I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF TURNING IT INTO THE STEREO PLAYER.  DURING THAT TIME IT HAS GONE THROUGH MANY CHANGES, COSMETIC (REMEMBER THE OLD WHITE SCREEN (SHUDDER)) AND IN FEATURES.  LOOKING BACK, I NOW WONDER HOW I WAS ABLE TO GET EVERYTHING IN THE PROGRAM THAT EVERYONE WANTED.AND I NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS FEAT IF IT WASN'T FOR MANY PEOPLE.  FIRST OFF, A BIG THANKS TO CRAIG CHAMBERLAIN AND HARRY BRATT FOR THE BEST MUSIC PROGRAM I HAVE EVER USED ON THE COMMODORE 64.  IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO CREATE MUSIC FOR USE ON THIS PLAYER AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS, THEN YOU SHOULD PURCHASE COMPUTE!'S MUSIC SYSTEM FOR THE COMMODORE 64 AND 128: ENHANCED EDITOR, BY CRAIG CHAMBERLAIN AND PUBLISHED BY COMPUTE!.I WOULD LIKE TO THANK JERRY ROTH (DR J5) FOR BEING THE BIGGEST PAIN IN THE BEHIND...  ACTUALLY IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM I WOULD HAVE OVERLOOKED MANY BUGS, AND SOME ENHANCEMENTS NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN PROGRAMMED INTO THE PROGRAM.  I THINK HIS BIGGEST WISH IS TO STILL BE AROUND WHEN 12.0 COMES OUT).ALSO, NICK ZELINSKI FOR MAKING THE MOST OBVIOUS SUGGESTION IN THE WORLD.  AT A TIME WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR A WAY TO MAKE A 6 VOICE PLAYER WHILE TRYING NOT TO MAKE A 6 VOICE EDITOR (WOULD HAVE TAKEN TOO LONG TO DO), HE SUGGESTS "WHY NOT MAKE TWO THREE VOICE SONGS AND HAVE THE PLAYER PLAY BOTH AT THE SAME TIME?"  DUH!!  YOU COULD HAVE KNOCKED ME OVER WITH A FEATHER.AND MANY OTHER THANKS TO JON, BOBBYE, LYRIC, JABBA, SYLVIA, DC AND ALL THE OTHERS I MISSED, FOR YOUR HELP AND  SUGGESTIONS (YEP, I DO LISTEN).NOW, YOU ARE PROBABLY WONDERING WHY I AM CALLING IT STEREO PLAYER 10.0 & 11.0.  THE REASON IS THAT I STILL DO NOT HAVE THE MIDI PORTION OF THE PROGRAM FINISHED.  THE SP LOOKS FOR A FILE CALLED 'MIDI.MODULE' DURING BOOT-UP.  IF THE FILE ISN'T FOUND THEN THE MIDI CONTROLS ARE DISABLED.  IF THE MODULE IS FOUND, THE CONTROLS ARE ENABLED AND THE PROGRAM WILL MODIFY ITS VERSION NUMBER TO REFLECT THE CHANGE.  YES, IF THE MODULE IS THERE STEREO PLAYER 10.0 AUTOMATICALLY CHANGES ITSELF INTO STEREO PLAYER 11.0.  SO DON'T GO LOOKING FOR A SP V11 AS THERE REALLY WON'T BE A RELEASE OF IT ALL COMBINED, BUT ONLY THE ADDITION OF THE 'MIDI.MODULE'.  WHO KNOWS MAYBE SOMETIME WAY, WAY DOWN THE ROAD I WILL FINALLY RELEASE A VERSION 12 (THAT WILL SIGNAL THE END).ONE OF THE BIG FIXES WAS THE INABILITY TO REALLY DISPLAY A PICTURE AND THE WORDS DURING A 6 VOICE PIECE OF MUSIC.  IN VERSION 8.0 YOU COULD HAVE PIC/WDS/MUS ALL AT ONCE AND IT WORKED.  WHEN YOU ADDED STR TO IT (PIC/WDS/MUS/STR) THE SCREEN WOULD FLICKER WHILE THE MUSIC WAS PLAYING.  THIS MADE IT UNACCEPTABLE, SO NOONE USED IT.  ON VERSION 9 (MAY IT ROT IN A DARK PLACE, IT WAS VERY BUGGY), NORMAL 3 VOICE (PIC/WDS/MUS) FILES FLICKERED AND 6 VOICE (PIC/WDS/MUS/STR) FILES WERE EVEN WORSE.  WELL, I AM GLAD TO ANNOUNCE THAT THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN COMPLETELY CURED.  YOU WILL NOLONGER SEE ANY FLICKER DURING 3 OR 6 VOICE SONGS THAT HAVE A PICTURE AND WORDS FILE.  NOW, YOU CAN USE THEM.THIS VERSION OF THE PLAYER ALSO SUPPORTS THE EXTENDED WORDS FILES AS WELL AS THE STANDARD WORDS FILES.  THERE HAS EVEN BEEN AN ADDITION AND UPGRADE TO THE EXTENDED WORDS FILES.  LOOK FOR VERSION 3 OF THE EXTENDED WORDS EDITOR SOMETIME IN SEPTEMBER.  THE PLAYER NOW SUPPORTS FULL SCREEN ANIMATED CHARACTER GRAPHICS.  HERE IS HOW IT WORKS.  YOU MUST USE EXTENDED WORDS V3 TO CREATE YOUR GRAPHICS.  NOW, IT WILL BE A LITTLE ODD TO HAVE KEYS, COLORS, NOTES AND OTHER ODD THINGS HAPPENING ON THE SCREEN WHILE YOU ARE TRYING TO DISPLAY GRAPHICS.  WHAT YOU MUST DO IS PUT A FLAG 255 IN YOUR MUSIC FILE.  THIS TELLS THE PLAYER TO TURN OFF ALL THE SCREEN UPDATES FOR THE KEYBOARD.  TO TURN THEM ALL BACK ON SEND A SECOND FLAG 255.  YOU CAN USE OTHER FLAGS FOR ANIMATING THE SCREEN JUST LIKE YOU WOULD FOR A NORMAL WORDS FILE.  IF THE WORDS FILE ISN'T EXTENDED, THE PLAYER WILL TREAT A FLAG 255 JUST LIKE A NORMAL FLAG AND LEAVE THE KEYBOARD ON.  TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE IT IS ALWAYS BEST TO USE ONLY FLAG 1 TO WORK WITH WORDS FILES.  THIS WILL ALLOW PROGRAMMERS TO MAKE ADDTIONS LIKE THE ONE HERE WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT ODD THINGS HAPPENING.NOW ON TO HOW THIS PUPPY WORKS.------------------------------------ONCE YOU HAVE LOADED THE PROGRAM, YOU WILL HEAR SOME MUSIC START TO PLAY AND THE MAIN SCREEN WILL START TO RISE UP FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.  YOU CAN ABORT THIS AT ANY TIME BY PRESSING THE RETURN KEY.  BE SURE TO HAVE YOUR MUSIC DISK IN THE DRIVE, AS THE PROGRAM WILL START TO LOOK FOR MUS FILES AS SOON AS THE RETURN KEY HAS BEEN PRESSED.  THERE IS A WAY TO BY-PASS THE OPENING COMPLETELY AND IT WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER.AFTER THE DIRECTORY HAS BEEN READ FROM THE DISK YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITH THE MAIN SCREEN WHICH IS DIVIDED INTO TWO HALVES.  THE LEFT HALF WILL ALWAYS DISPLAY A LIST OF AVAILIBLE SONGS, TEN MAXIMUM AT ANY ONE TIME.  YOU CAN USE THE CURSOR KEYS TO SCROLL THE LISTING UP OR DOWN ON THE SCREEN.  THE PROGRAM WILL SUPPORT UPTO 220 SONGS, ANYMORE THAN THAT WILL BE IGNORED.  JUST BELOW THE SONG LIST IS A WINDOW THAT WILL INDICATE WHAT ASSOCIATED FILES ARE WITH THE SONG.  THESE ARE:P - PICTURE FILE, A - ANIMATION FILE, S - STEREO FILE AND W - WORD FILE.THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN WILL PRESENT A LIST OF AVAILIBLE COMMANDS.  IF YOU PRESS THE COMMODORE KEY THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN WILL CHANGE TO A SECOND LIST OF COMMANDS.  YOU MAY CONTINUE TO TOGGLE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO COMMAND SCREENS BY PRESSING THE COMMODORE KEY.  COMMANDS THAT CAN BE CHANGED LIKE ADDRESS, REPEAT AND ECT. CAN ONLY BE CHANGED IF THEY ARE VISABLE.THE FOLLOWING IS A TABLE OF THE AVAILIBLE COMMANDS WITH A DESCRIPTION OF EACH ONE.------------------------------------MAIN SCREEN - COMMANDS SCREEN #1--------------------------------F1 - PLAY SONGTHIS WILL IMMEDIATELY PLAY THE SONG THAT IS CURRENTLY HIGHLIGHTED IN WHITE ON THE SONG LIST.
